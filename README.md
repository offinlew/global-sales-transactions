Use Tableau to create a story (a collection of dashboards) to discover commercial insights from a provided dataset. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate your ability to create effective data visualisations using Tableau to communicate key insights to senior management.

The deliverable content will be a story (a collection of five dashboards) created in Tableau.

Your task will be to explore the dataset using Tableau's data visualisation tools in an effort to extract commercially-important insights in preparation for a presentation of your findings to senior management of the company.

Which visualisations and which variables you wish to explore will be depend on your judgement. The task is designed to simulate real-life situations when business analysts are faced with raw data and need to spend time exploring, or mining, the dataset hoping to discover interesting trends, patterns and relationships.

- How clear your dashboards are, i.e. how effective your chosen visualisations are at showing the insights.

- Creativity and imagination in your choice of visualisations.
